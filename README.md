## Installation

Ready to powerup your realtor experience? Follow the following steps to install the software!

1. Download from GitHub:
Visit the GitHub repository and locate the folder of the desired Chrome extension. Click on the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP" to save the folder to your local machine. Unzip the download.

2. Locate the Lines for User ID and PIN:
Search for the following lines of code in the background.js file:
```javascript
getElementByXpath(`//*[@id="clareity"]`).innerHTML = "your userID"; // EDIT this line prior to use
getElementByXpath(`//*[@id="pin"]`).innerHTML = "your user PIN"; // EDIT this line prior to use
```

3. Edit and Save:
Modify "your userID" and "your user PIN" to include the actual user ID and PIN values you want to use for authentication within the extension. For example:

```javascript
getElementByXpath(`//*[@id="clareity"]`).innerHTML = "1234567"; // Your actual userID
getElementByXpath(`//*[@id="pin"]`).innerHTML = "1234"; // Your actual PIN
```

4. Access Chrome Extension Manager:
Open Google Chrome and navigate to the browser's menu (three dots on the top right). Choose "More Tools" and then select "Extensions" from the dropdown menu.

5. Load Unpacked Extension:
Once in the Extensions manager, ensure the "Developer mode" toggle in the top right corner is switched on. Click on "Load unpacked" and navigate to the downloaded folder's location on your computer. Select the folder and click "Open" to load the extension into Chrome.

6. Pin to Toolbar:
After loading the unpacked extension, you'll find its icon added to the Extensions manager. To pin it to the toolbar for easy access, locate the extension icon within the Extensions manager, then click on the extension's pin icon (often an image of a pin or the extension logo). This action will place the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar for quick access whenever needed.

Enjoy Your New Extension:
Your extension is now readily accessible from the Chrome toolbar. Click on the icon whenever you want to use its functionality.
